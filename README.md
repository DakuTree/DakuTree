### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on:
  - A web tool for managing large game libraries; similar to `BackLoggery`.  
    Don't expect this anytime soon.
  - An imageboard (like `Danbooru`/`Shimmie`) built using `Symfony`.  
    This is more of a learning project for me than anything.
  - Open-sourcing some of my closed-source projects! Soonâ„¢
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning:
  - For work: `Azure`, `Python`, `Nginx` and a couple of other things at scale.
  - For fun: `Symfony` and `Python`.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: See my blog/twitter links to the left!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I spend far too much time thinking what to do or how to do something than actually doing it!
